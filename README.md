# Discord-Repilt-Bot-Code
Hey guys
This is my first ever github code
This code was copied from an IGP video
I reccomend you to check him out!
I decided 2 put this code here for u lazy ppl :)
There will be 2 parts. The shell code and the normal code.
Yes the shell code is in Imagine Game Play's profile
But I will still post it here.
Quick thing the piece of code below CAN be
Modified to your likings.

Bye!
 Nascar

(Heres the line of code I was talking about)
client.on("message", message => {
  if(message.content === "ping") {
    message.channel.send("pong")

(edit: you CAN do this in Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code too! Just make sure you have discord.js installed.
i will show how to do in another README)
